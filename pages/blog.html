        <p>A personal blog for my thoughts, photos and other musings. I included a video game theme because I grew up playing Mario &amp; Mega Man...and they just look cool. Styled with Twitter Bootstrap, the blog logo in the corner is a custom font called 'Monstro'. Comments and contact page are in modal windows, which allowed me to keep the design clean. Deployed on Heroku. 
        </p>
        <p>The blog features a User model with Admin level functions, handrolled authentication via the bcrypt gem, image upload capability via Amazon AWS S3 and the Paperclip gem and a comment system. Comments belong to users, and users must be logged in to create a comment.
