            <p>Social borrowing platform, this app lets you add friends and search for items based on location or name. The main feature of OfferUp! is the search system, which combines location based search as well as item search across all your friends. We used the Geocoder gem to narrow results down by location, and Elasticsearch/Searchkick to search across all fields in the Goods model. 
            </p>
            <p>OfferUp! features a friending system &amp; user dashboard that allows you to search goods, view/add friends or add your own offers. Requesting a good from a friend brings up an auto-populated email to arrange the details.
            </p>
            <p>As an additional challenge we decided to create an iPhone/Android app using AngularJS and the Ionic framework. We exposed our own API endpoints and consumed that data with the mobile app. A very rewarding challenge indeed!
