            <p>An alumni social network for graduates of General Assembly. GA has a worldwide network of UX/UI designers, business experts,  full stack developers and talented people of all kinds. We wanted to design an app where they could join up, share events, post job information, and bounce ideas off one another. 
            </p>
            <p>Alum.ly has a user account system with Bcrypt authentication, job board with Google Maps Autocomplete and Google Maps API integration, Events board (also with Maps), Forum and Alumni list.  All these are searchable across all columns in the table, including partial word matches. This was also my first experience with TDD, writing Rspec tests for model and controller actions. 
            </p>
            <p>We decided to style Alum.ly with just straight CSS, creating our own column/grid system in the process. A huge learning opportunity for everyone involved!
